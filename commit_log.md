    finished the barebones of the comment card.

    except for the modal, all else is superficially done for both mobile and desktop. 
com5
    added the modal.

    the score number now changes, added the specific comment elements for the current active user, added the hover effect on clicable elements, defined the comments and user data and the comments_model service and maybe some more minor adjusts.
com7
    added the reply action and even the animation for it but it still need some work.
